        <h3>“I love movies. Gosh I love movies. I love watching them, and I love making them.” Keanu Reeves</h3> <br>
        <h1>I followed my heart </h1>
        Life is short and everyone has something that they are passionate about. Be able to say that you didn't let fear
        hold you back. The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.
        <br>
        <h1>I believe in myself</h1>
        Even if you fail, it doesn't mean you will continue to fail. Be able to say you believed in yourself and kept
        trying. Everything that is successful will begin with you believing in yourself.
        <br>
        <h1>I live by high standards</h1>
        Never apologize for high standards; people who really want to be in your life will rise up to meet them. The
        quality of who you are is reflected in the standards you set for yourself; position yourself to live up to the
        rise of your own expectations.
        <br>
        <h1>I treat others the way I want to be treated</h1>
        Talk to people the way you want to be spoken to; respect people as you wish to be respected. Your status,
        religion, race, political views, or culture don't matter--being a good person really is as simple as following
        the golden rule and treating others as you would like them to treat you.
        <br>
        <h1>I understand how precious time is</h1>
        Be able to say that you didn't waste time. Remember that time is free but priceless, that you can't own it but
        you can spend it--wisely or unwisely. Treat time as a resource to be invested carefully.
        <br>
        <h1>I look for positivity in all things</h1>
        Instead of thinking of all the things that can go wrong, become one of the people who look on how they go right.
        Your mind is powerful, and when you fill it with positivity your life naturally becomes positive. When you think
        positive thoughts, positive things will happen.
        <br>
        <h1>I trust my intuition</h1>
        Don't let anyone talk you out of what you know to be true. Trust your inner voice and allow yourself to be led
        by your intuition. The more empowered you become, the stronger you become and the happier you become. Avoid
        going against your better judgment or getting talked into things that don't feel right.
